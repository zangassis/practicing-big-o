# Practicing Big ‚≠ï

This project contains a sample ASP.NET Core app. This app is an example of the article I produced for the Telerik Blog (telerik.com/blogs).

This project brings 5 examples of time complexity in Big O Notation in ASP.NET Core

- O(1) - Constant time complexity
- O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity
- O(n) - Linear time complexity
- O(n log n) - Log-linear time complexity
- O(n¬≤) - Quadratic time complexity

### Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To run these examples, make sure you have .NET 8 installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Open the solution file using Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
4. Explore each example to understand how time complexity affects algorithm performance.
5. Contributing ü§ù
   
If you have new insights or additional algorithms to showcase, feel free to submit a pull request.
